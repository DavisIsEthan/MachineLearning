# Senior Thesis

This repository stores files related to my senior thesis project in machine learning with a touch of GPU computing.

**PLEASE NOTE:** Classifier, Classifier_GPU, and Labeller were all originally created by [Dr. Vyacheslav Olshevsky](https://bitbucket.org/volshevsky/mmslearning/src/master/). The files here contain edited and new code for the purposes of my thesis project; that code is my own work, but the files themselves are not and should not be considered such.
